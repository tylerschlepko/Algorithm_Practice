/*
You have been tasked with solving a backtracking problem in JavaScript. 
Your goal is to generate all possible permutations of a given set of numbers. 
For example, if the set is [1, 2, 3], the possible permutations are:

[1, 2, 3] [1, 3, 2] [2, 1, 3] [2, 3, 1] [3, 1, 2] [3, 2, 1]

To accomplish this, you must implement a backtracking algorithm that explores all 
possible solutions by incrementally building candidates to the solutions 
and rejecting a candidate if it fails to satisfy the problem's constraints. 
The constraint, in this case, is that each permutation must use all elements in the 
set exactly once.

Your implementation must include a function that takes the set of numbers as input 
and returns an array of all possible permutations. You may assume that the input set 
is of reasonable size (e.g., less than 10 elements) and does not contain duplicates.
*/

const perms = (arr) =>{
    //arr that contains the possible permutations
    //nested loop
    //outer goes from 0 to arr.length
    //inner will have go from 0 to arr.length 
        //inside the inner loop it will check that the number is not the outerloop it will do nothing 
        //
}
